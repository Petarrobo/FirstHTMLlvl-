                <b> Idvorski Pupin</b>, Ph.D., LL.D.<i> (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935)</i>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. 

                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization"). 

               Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics <i>(NACA)</i> on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.
